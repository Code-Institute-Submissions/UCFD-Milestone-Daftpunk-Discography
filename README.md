# Skeleton Plane
### Wireframes

All wireframes are the core skelteton to aid in the planning process and are not the final look of the design. I recommend that the PNG's are downloaded to be viewed in your own browser.

# Surface Plane

## Brand Image
The branding Image or better known as a logo is a key aspect to draw attenttion to the user. Intially I chose a popular image that is associated with the artists 2001 album "discovery" 
unfortuanly this image clashed with my over all theme, therefore I went for a more subtle and stylistic approach which complimented the theme of the project which the idea was taken from the 2013 album cover 
"Random Access Memories". The logo was downloaded as a PNG for its transparency benefits. Logos where taken from a free to use website called [pngwing](https://www.pngwing.com/).

* First Idea - [Initial logo](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/659/114/png-transparent-daft-punk-logo-punk-rock-daft-punk-angle-text-black-and-white-thumbnail.png)
* Final Idea - [Current logo](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/305/972/png-transparent-united-states-logo-organization-information-service-daft-punk-angle-trademark-service-thumbnail.png)




## Colour Schemes

A colour scheme is one of the first elements to communicate the message behind the design on both visual and psychological levels.
The process of choosing my pallet was inspired with the artists costume choice from the album [Random Access Memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories#/media/File:Random_Access_Memories.jpg) 
which combinines black,white and gold, which achives a stylish, easy on the eye look. All colours were generated on [html Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/).

<img src="static/images/colour-theme.png">

The final colour choices where assesed with in the guidlines of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Each colour was used with [Contrast Ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23212121-on-%23F0F3F4) and graded with in the guidlines of [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) .

* Light black (#212121)aginst off white back ground(#F0F3F4) (AAA Standard)
* Light grey (#6C757D) against off white background (#F0F3F4) Which fails a (AA standard) by 4px. To fit in with my design ideas for a sleek finish I settled with a slight darker grey of #616161 (AA Standard)
* Dark gold text (B7950B) against black backgorund (#212121) (AA Standard)    

Below are the final colour choices for my project

* Background Colour is off white (#F0F3F4)
* Primary Font Colour lighter shade of black (#212121)
* Muted fonts (#616161)
* Primary and secondary buttons are shades of gold (#D4AC0D)
   * Hover CSS (#B7950B) 
   * Border (#fff)
* Repeated call to action points at the head of the page
  * Font colour dark gold (#B7950B) whith a white off button (#F0F3F4)
  * When hovered turns to dark gold (#B7950B) to interact with the user. 
* Social links light shade of black #212121) against off white backgorund (#F0F3F4)
  * Hover CSS (#D4AC0D) 

## Typography 

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font was used to keep a minimalistic design through out my project to help maintain consistency. Font taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Font weights used from 300,400 and 500 for an easier reading experiance.

## Images

The majority of the images used come from various websites from  [google images](https://www.google.com/search?q=daft+punk&sxsrf=ALeKk01K83Y46gV6bW7IWsCVMwhTjz7ZIQ:1611326366247&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibnbW94q_uAhWROcAKHdHzBFsQ_AUoAXoECBMQAw&biw=1590&bih=837&dpr=2)
when you search daft punk, all images used will be credited in the credits section of my readme.
The nav bar Image and footer Image was designed by my girlfriend which was created on an app called [Procreate](https://procreate.art/).

## Visual Interactions

### navbar

The navbar links hover effects are applied to users only viewing with a desktop. To engage with the user a verticle white line sweeps under text when hoverd over. this small effect keeps the user engaged and assists with the minimalistic design. 


### Social Links

Large eye catcning social links found at each footer of the page painted light black with an off white background repeating the designs aesthetics for consistency. When the user hovers or engages with the link a subtle backgorund colour change too gold to encourage interaction.

### Buttons and C2A

Buttons posistioned in eye catching areas to encourage engagement. white text with a gold background when inactive but when engaged jumps to a slight off gold so the user knows his action has been Acknowledged. The most important call to action sitting at the top of the page (engages contact with user) highlighted white on a black background when interacted turns gold to match text written before.


# Features

## Exsiting

#### Desktop,tablet and mobile responsive
   * All pages have been incorparated with Bootstraps built in `flexbox` tool allowing each web page to be responsove 
   on all devices giving the user complete felixabilty on all screen sizes and resolutions. All features implemented have been 
   adjusted to size where necceserry in the `stylesheet.css` using `@media` allowing you to not only vary viewport dimensions based on screen size, but allowing me to set different style properties for different devices.

#### Navigation bar
   * The navigation bar at the head of every page with a custom designed background to match the websites theme. the navigatiuons bar allows users to navigate each page freely. 
   `sticky-top` menus allows me to make sure the navigation access always visible to the user when browsing larger pages of content. All navbars have the artists logo attached with a clikable response 
   sending the user back to the home page.

#### Footer
   * Like with the navigation bar there is also a sticky footer at the foot of all webpages, mirroring the design of the navigation bar.
   three interactive social links that are in sending the user in a new tab to the artists soical accounts.

#### Modals
   * A modal is a dialog box/popup window that is displayed on top of each page. they help to free up content with out cluttering the surface. 
   My modal is linked with a C2A allowing the user to sign up to a newsletter. making that initial point of contact extremely user friendly. 


#### Media Players
   * Audio<br>
   As my website is for users to be able to freely browse and listen to releases of the artists dicography. Audio snippets have been added to each release with added controls
   for users to play,pause,stop and alter the volume of media. 

   * Video<br>
    video embedding into the browser with multiple tags that give more control over the video and player. You can play,stop,pause,alter the volume,make the screen full width of your device and download the media.
    Multimedia of this variety is useful to site visitors who have literacy challenges and those with visual, audio or cognitive disabilities.

 
### Features To Implement
#### Processing the contact form
* The informaton that the user submits will not process. with additonal Python or SQL language the data can then be processed and stored.

#### CAPTCHA
* Adding a [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) to the form to authenticate that a real person is submiting data. this will help block spammers and bots from collecting email addresses and submiting fake data.

#### Forum/Discussion Area
* Implementing a Discussion area is a great way to get users to return to your page. This will help create a communitiy where users will have a lot higher level of investment than a user just passing through. This feature could be Implemented into its own navigation tab so the returning user can naviugate easliy to the desired forum.

* Thank you to the slack community for guiding me in the right direction.

* Thank you to the tutors at code institute for that quick and helpful responses.

* Thank you to my mentor Rohit for giving me pointers along the way.
