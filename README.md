# Surface Plane

## Brand Image
The branding Image or better known as a logo is a key aspect to draw attenttion to the user. Intially I chose a popular image that is associated with the artists 2001 album "discovery" 
unfortuanly this image clashed with my over all theme, therefore I went for a more subtle and stylistic approach which complimented the theme of the project which the idea was taken from the 2013 album cover 
"Random Access Memories". The logo was downloaded as a PNG for its transparency benefits. Logos where taken from a free to use website called [pngwing](https://www.pngwing.com/).

* First Idea - [Initial logo](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/659/114/png-transparent-daft-punk-logo-punk-rock-daft-punk-angle-text-black-and-white-thumbnail.png)
* Final Idea - [Current logo](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/305/972/png-transparent-united-states-logo-organization-information-service-daft-punk-angle-trademark-service-thumbnail.png)




## Colour Schemes

A colour scheme is one of the first elements to communicate the message behind the design on both visual and psychological levels.
The process of choosing my pallet was inspired with the artists costume choice from the album [Random Access Memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories#/media/File:Random_Access_Memories.jpg) 
which combinines black,white and gold, which achives a stylish, easy on the eye look. All colours were generated on [html Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/).

<img src="static/images/colour-theme.png">

The final colour choices where assesed with in the guidlines of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Each colour was used with [Contrast Ratio](https://contrast-ratio.com/#%23212121-on-%23F0F3F4) and graded with in the guidlines of [W3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) .

* Light black (#212121)aginst off white back ground(#F0F3F4) (AAA Standard)
* Light grey (#6C757D) against off white background (#F0F3F4) Which fails a (AA standard) by 4px. To fit in with my design ideas for a sleek finish I settled with a slight darker grey of #616161 (AA Standard)
* Dark gold text (B7950B) against black backgorund (#212121) (AA Standard)    

Below are the final colour choices for my project

* Background Colour is off white (#F0F3F4)
* Primary Font Colour lighter shade of black (#212121)
* Muted fonts (#616161)
* Primary and secondary buttons are shades of gold (#D4AC0D)
   * Hover CSS (#B7950B) 
   * Border (#fff)
* Repeated call to action points at the head of the page
  * Font colour dark gold (#B7950B) whith a white off button (#F0F3F4)
  * When hovered turns to dark gold (#B7950B) to interact with the user. 
* Social links light shade of black #212121) against off white backgorund (#F0F3F4)
  * Hover CSS (#D4AC0D) 

## Typography 

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font was used to keep a minimalistic design through out my project to help maintain consistency. Font taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Font weights used from 300,400 and 500 for an easier reading experiance.

## Images

The majority of the images used come from various websites from  [google images](https://www.google.com/search?q=daft+punk&sxsrf=ALeKk01K83Y46gV6bW7IWsCVMwhTjz7ZIQ:1611326366247&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibnbW94q_uAhWROcAKHdHzBFsQ_AUoAXoECBMQAw&biw=1590&bih=837&dpr=2)
when you search daft punk, all images used will be credited in the credits section of my readme.
The nav bar Image and footer Image was designed by my girlfriend which was created on an app called [Procreate](https://procreate.art/).

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
